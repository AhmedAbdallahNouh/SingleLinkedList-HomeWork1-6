## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the "Data Structures and Algorithms Mastery" course. In this repository, you'll find my solutions to the 5 easy challenges related to single linked lists.

## Tasks
### Task 1: insert front 

list.insertFront(5); <br>
list.insertFront(20); <br>
list.insertFront(7); <br>
list.print(); <br>
Output:
// 5 20 7 

### Task 2: Delete front
list : 5 20 7 8 <br>
list.DeleteFront(); <br>
Output:
//  20 7 8
### Task 3:  GetNodeFromEndByPosition
Given 1-based position, find it from the back <br>
● E..g. if list is 1 2 3 4 5 6 <br>
● GetNodeFromEndByPosition(1) should point to node with value 6 <br>


### Task 4:  Is Same list’s data?
● Develop function to check if lists are data-equal:    
     <br> ○ Same length - each node and its corresponding one has same value    
     <br> ○ bool is_same(const LinkedList &other)
    
● Provide 2 codes <br>
    ○ One code assumes a variable length is maintained <br>
    That tells us how many nodes so far <br>
    ■ E.g. in each insert, length is  increased <br> 
    ○ Another that doesn’t use it and don’t  compute lengt <br>
    
### Task 5: Linked List without tail/length!
#### Note
For this task, the goal is to insert elements at the end of a linked list and get Tail and Print Linked List. Note that the linked list used for this task doesn't have a tail or length. To implement this, I've created a `BasicSingleLinkedList` class that contains just the head.
